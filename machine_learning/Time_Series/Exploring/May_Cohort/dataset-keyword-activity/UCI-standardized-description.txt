   -- Predicted attribute : 
        Activity generated by a keyword in a online social network. This is prediction is done using a ``learning to rank'' setting, in which the most active keyword has rank 0, while the less one has rank ``max''.

   -- Study results : 
        The results achieved indicates that, when considering a sub-sample of 300 keywords:
          1. We achieved the best ranking on keywords that belong to the [0; 60] ranks.
          2. We achieved the worst results on keywords that belong to the [200; 300 ranks.
          3. High (resp. low) ambiguity levels may lead to higher ranking errors on keywords that belong to the [60;300] ranks.  

4. Relevant Information Paragraph:
   -- Observations : 
        Each instance covers seven days of observation for a specific keyword (eg. 
        Smartphone...). The ranking is performed accordingly to their activities on the two days following the observation.


5. Number of Instances
   -- Total number of instances : 51, each of these contains 1497 keywords to rank. Hence in a point-wise view there is 51*1497 = 76347 time-series each of them belonging to only one single ranking instance.


6. Number of Attributes 
   -- Total number of attributes : 35. 

   -- Time representation : 
        Each instance is described by 35 features, those describe the evolution
        of 5 `primary features' during a 7 days periods. Hence each feature name is 
        postfixed with the relative time of observation. For instance, the value
        of the feature `Z' at time t is given in 'Z_t'.


7. Attributes

    -- activity (columns [0,6])

       -- Type : Numeric, integers only 
       -- Description : This feature matches the number of tweets/contributions  
          captured at time step t and with the keyword of this instance.
       -- Columns : From column 0 (Activity at relative time 0) to column 6 (Activity at 
          relative time 6)
       -- Statistics : 
          see files in stats.tar.gz


    -- number_of_users (columns [7,13])

       -- Type : Numeric, integers only 
       -- Description : This feature captures the number of authors that used at 
          the keyword of this instance at time step t. 
       -- Columns : From column 7 (number_of_users at relative time 0) to column 13 
          (number_of_users at relative time 6)
       -- Statistics :

    -- user_balance (columns [14,20])

       -- Type : Numeric, real in [0,1]
       -- Description : This feature is a measure the number of users that use the 
          keyword of this instance for the first time at time step t.
       -- Columns : From column 14 (user_balance at relative time 0) to column 20
          (user_balance at relative time 6)

    -- attention_level_number_of_users (columns [21,27])

       -- Type : Numeric, defined on [0,1] 
       -- Description : This feature is the ratio of the number of users that use 
          the keyword of this instance at time step t on the number of users that 
          use any other keywords at t.
       -- Columns : From column 21 to column 27 
       -- Statistics :

    -- attention_level_activity (columns [28,34])

       -- Type : Numeric, defined on [0,1] 
       -- Description : This feature is the ratio of the number of tweets that 
          encompass the keyword of this instance at time step t on the number of tweets that encompasses any other keywords at t.
       -- Columns : From column 21 to column 27
