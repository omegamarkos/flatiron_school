**Course**: DS   <br/>
**Mod**: Mod 4 Sec 32 V2         <br/>
**Topic**: Time Series: ARMA Models  <br/>
**Amount of time**: 60 minutes <br/>
**Author**: Vishal Patel

#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson is a lecture based presentation of ARMA models. It begins with some introductory theory regarding Autoregressive and Moving Average Models before showing their joint integration into ARMA models. From there, a practical implementation is shown. The appendix includes additional extensions for ARIMAX and SARIMAX models.

#### Topic:

Time Series

#### Learning goals for this lesson:

* Students will be able to define the intuition behind AR models.
* Students will be able to define the intuition behind MA models.
* Students will be able to define the intuition behind ARMA models.
* Students will be able to implement an ARMA model for a time series dataset.


#### Prerequisite knowledge:

* Students should know how to make a time series stationary using differencing.
* Students should be able to plot and interpret a PACF plot for a time series dataset.
